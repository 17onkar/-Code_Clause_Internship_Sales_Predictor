# Sales Prediction using Python in Jupyter Notebook

This project is aimed at predicting future sales using machine learning algorithms in Python, implemented within a Jupyter Notebook environment. Its primary objective is to forecast sales based on historical data, providing insights and potential forecasting models for business decision-making.

## Overview

This project leverages various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to conduct data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and sales prediction. The primary emphasis is on employing regression models to predict sales based on historical patterns and other relevant features.

## Installation

To execute this project, ensure Python is installed on your system. You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

## File Descriptions
sales_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code for sales prediction.
data/: Directory housing datasets utilized for analysis and prediction.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Data
The dataset employed in this project comprises historical sales data encompassing various features such as date, product information, pricing, promotions, etc. This data serves as the basis for training the machine learning models for sales prediction.

## Methods and Techniques
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
Data preprocessing and cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones for better model performance.
Implementation of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc.): Training and evaluating models for sales prediction.
Model evaluation and selection: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Results
The outcomes of the sales prediction models are showcased in the Jupyter Notebook. Evaluation metrics are employed to gauge the performance of the models, aiding in determining their effectiveness in predicting sales accurately.

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements for this project encompass:

Incorporating more advanced feature engineering techniques to capture nuanced patterns.
Experimenting with diverse machine learning algorithms to ascertain the best-performing models.
Tuning hyperparameters for improved model performance.
Addressing seasonality and external factors that might influence sales but are not yet accounted for in the models.
